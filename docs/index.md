# Overview

![k3d](static/img/k3d_logo_black_blue.svg)

**This page is targeting k3d v4.0.0 and newer!**

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

## Installation

You have several options there:

### [:fontawesome-regular-file-code: Install Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh)

#### Install current latest release

- wget: `#!bash wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash`
- curl: `#!bash curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash`

#### Install specific release

Use the install script to grab a specific release (via `TAG` environment variable):

- wget: `#!bash wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v4.0.0 bash`
- curl: `#!bash curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v4.0.0 bash`

### Other Installers

??? Tip "Other Installation Methods"

    - [:fontawesome-solid-beer: Homebrew (MacOS/Linux)](https://brew.sh): `#!bash brew install k3d`

        *Note*: The formula can be found in [homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/k3d.rb) and is mirrored to [homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/blob/master/Formula/k3d.rb)

    - [:material-arch: AUR (Arch Linux User Repository)](https://aur.archlinux.org/):  `#!bash yay -S rancher-k3d-bin`

      Package [rancher-k3d-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rancher-k3d-bin/)

    - [:material-github: Download GitHub Release](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/releases)

      Grab a release binary from the [release tab](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/releases) and install it yourself

    - [:material-microsoft-windows: Chocolatey (Windows)](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install k3d`

      *Note*: package source can be found in [erwinkersten/chocolatey-packages](https://github.com/erwinkersten/chocolatey-packages/tree/master/automatic/k3d)

    - [arkade](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade): `arkade get k3d`

    - [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com): `asdf plugin-add k3d && asdf install k3d latest`

      *Note*: `asdf plugin-add k3d`, then `asdf install k3d <tag>` with `<tag> = latest` or `4.x.x` for a specific version (maintained by [spencergilbert/asdf-k3d](https://github.com/spencergilbert/asdf-k3d))

    - Others
      - install via go: `#!bash go install github.com/rancher/k3d@latest` (**Note**: this will give you unreleased/bleeding-edge changes)

## Quick Start

Create a cluster named `mycluster` with just a single server node:

```bash
k3d cluster create mycluster
```

Use the new cluster with [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), e.g.:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

??? Note "Getting the cluster's kubeconfig (included in `k3d cluster create`)"
    Get the new cluster's connection details merged into your default kubeconfig (usually specified using the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or the default path `#!bash $HOME/.kube/config`) and directly switch to the new context:

    ```bash
    k3d kubeconfig merge mycluster --kubeconfig-switch-context
    ```
