/* DESCRIPTION
 * The Loadbalancer is a customized NGINX container running side-by-side with the cluster, NOT INSIDE IT.
 * It is used to do plain proxying of tcp/udp ports to the k3d node containers.
 * One advantage of this approach is, that we can add new ports while the cluster is still running by re-creating
 * the loadbalancer and adding the new port config in the NGINX config. As the loadbalancer doesn't hold any state
 * (apart from the config file), it can easily be re-created in just a few seconds.
