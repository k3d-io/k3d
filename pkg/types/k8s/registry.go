// LocalRegistryHostingV1 describes a local registry that developer tools can

	// assume the local registry is not available to them.

	// When tools apply Kubernetes objects to the cluster, this host should be
	// used for image name fields. If not set, users of this field should use the
	// value of Host instead.

	// (e.g., a version control SHA).
