## k3s in docker

k3s is the lightweight Kubernetes distribution by Rancher: [rancher/k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s)

This repository is based on [@zeerorg](https://github.com/zeerorg/)'s [zeerorg/k3s-in-docker](https://github.com/zeerorg/k3s-in-docker), reimplemented in Go by [@iwilltry42](https://github.com/iwilltry42/) in [iwilltry42/k3d](https://github.com/iwilltry42/k3d), which is now [rancher/k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d).

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Get

You have several options there:

- use the install script to grab the latest release:
  - wget: `wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/master/install.sh | bash`
  - curl: `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/master/install.sh | bash`
- use the install script to grab a specific release (via `TAG` environment variable):
  - wget: `wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/master/install.sh | TAG=v1.3.4 bash`
  - curl: `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/master/install.sh | TAG=v1.3.4 bash`

- Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `brew install k3d` (Homebrew is avaiable for MacOS and Linux)
  - Formula can be found in [homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/k3d.rb) and is mirrored to [homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/blob/master/Formula/k3d.rb)
- Grab a release from the [release tab](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/releases) and install it yourself.
- Via go: `go install github.com/rancher/k3d` (**Note**: this will give you unreleased/bleeding-edge changes)

or...

## Build

1. Clone this repo, e.g. via `go get -u github.com/rancher/k3d`
2. Inside the repo run
   - 'make install-tools' to make sure required go packages are installed
3. Inside the repo run one of the following commands
   - `make build` to build for your current system
   - `go install` to install it to your `GOPATH` (**Note**: this will give you unreleased/bleeding-edge changes)
   - `make build-cross` to build for all systems

## Usage

Check out what you can do via `k3d help`

Example Workflow: Create a new cluster and use it with `kubectl`
(*Note:* `kubectl` is not part of `k3d`, so you have to [install it first if needed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/))

1. `k3d create` to create a new single-node cluster (docker container)
2. `export KUBECONFIG=$(k3d get-kubeconfig)` to make `kubectl` to use the kubeconfig for that cluster
3. execute some commands like `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
4. `k3d delete` to delete the default cluster

### Exposing Services

If you want to access your services from the outside (e.g. via Ingress), you need to map the ports (e.g. port 80 for Ingress) using the `--publish` flag (or aliases).
Check out the [examples here](docs/examples.md).
